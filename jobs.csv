Are you interested in shaping the future of entertainment? Do you want to define the next generation of how and what Amazon customers are watching? Prime Video is changing the way people watch movies and TV. From one service, we’re delivering versatile ways to watch hundreds of thousands of movies, TV series, and live events on the web, mobile, and TV. Our service is available in more than 200 territories globally, and we’re just getting started.  

  

Working closely with business and technology partners, we use research, design, and prototyping to guide early product development, bring clarity to engineering goals, and develop a customer\-centric point of view. This is where you come in.  

  

As a Design Technologist, you'll be a key part of our Experience Design organization. Your role will be all about proving, advancing, and evolving forward\-thinking UX concepts through prototyping and hands\-on product work. You'll work alongside other design technologists to bring design ideas (interactions, visuals, motion) to life.

We build prototypes across the Prime Video customer journey from helping customers discover their favorite content to designing new playback experiences including X\-Ray, live sports, and advertising. Our team builds high\-fidelity prototypes for TV, mobile and web clients using frontend technologies such as HTML/CSS/JS, React.js, Redux and Motion.js. Our team develops prototypes using AWS Bedrock to envision brand new Gen AI powered experiences for our customers.
  

  

About the team  

We’re scrappy yet detailed\-oriented, knowing when to build quickly versus diving into the details to produce higher fidelity prototypes. We bring our own design vision and support our design and engineering partners to help them ship faster. We also partner closely with UX researchers to create new experiences that our customers get to test and provide feedback on. Our prototypes are demoed to senior leadership to showcase what the future of Prime Video will look and feel like for our customers.

DMS owns the Cockpit backend services that move payload data from our satellites to our customers. The team builds and maintains the services that ingest data from ground stations, process and categorize it, track it end‑to‑end, and deliver it reliably to internal tools and external endpoints.  

You’ll help design and scale the microservices and data pipelines that sit between ground segment, satellite operations, and customer deliveries \- turning raw on‑orbit data into usable products. You’ll work closely with backend, ground software, flight software, space infrastructure, and customer operations teams, and you’ll have a direct impact on how quickly and reliably customers receive their data. We also offer SatDevOps training, so you don’t just write the tools \- you actually use them to operate spacecraft.  

If you’re excited about building backend systems that move and transform satellite data at scale \- and you like the idea of both shipping code and seeing how it performs in real operations \- we’d love to hear from you.
### **About this Role:**

* + **Design and build backend services for data ingest, processing, and delivery** that move payload data from ground stations and other sources into Cockpit and out to customer endpoints.
	+ **Implement and improve data pipelines and APIs** with a strong focus on data correctness, traceability, performance, and reliability.
	+ **Own and evolve backend components** such as connectors, processing jobs, and delivery services that other Cockpit teams and customer‑facing tools depend on.
	+ **Collaborate with other Cockpit teams and stakeholders** (mission management, mission operations, space infrastructure, customer operations) to make sure on‑orbit tasking and ground data flows work smoothly together.
	+ **Support internal users of Cockpit’s data services** by improving APIs, debugging tricky data issues, and strengthening observability (metrics, logs, dashboards).
	+ **Have the opportunity to take part in spacecraft operations** through SatDevOps rotations, occasionally helping investigate data‑related anomalies and supporting real‑time incident response when needed.

### **Must Haves:**

* + Strong Python development experience in a production environment.
	+ Experience with Docker and container‑based development.
	+ Hands‑on experience with backend web development frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask, FastAPI, etc.).
	+ Proven API design skills (designing, documenting, and maintaining HTTP/GraphQL/REST‑style APIs).
	+ Practical experience working with databases and data‑centric backend services.

### **Nice to Haves:**

* + Experience with Django and/or GraphQL.
	+ Strong database fundamentals and experience with Postgres or similar relational databases.
	+ Exposure to time‑series or analytical data systems (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, or similar).
	+ Experience building or operating data pipelines (batch or streaming) and large‑volume data processing systems.
	+ Exposure to Kubernetes and cloud‑native deployments in production.
	+ Background in mission‑critical, distributed, or real‑time systems, especially data‑intensive ones (space or otherwise).
	+ Experience collaborating with international, distributed teams across time zones and cultures.

* Full Time, but can be a Contract\-to\-Hire arrangement.

We are seeking a high\-output **AI Full\-Stack Engineer** to build and maintain **Agentic Systems** that drive autonomous business logic. In this role, you will act as a **Pilot Developer**, leveraging **Cursor or similar tools** to architect, build, and deploy end\-to\-end features.

You are not expected to spend your day writing code. Instead, you will understand business needs thoroughly, create a clear intuitive vision of how the product will look like and use AI\-native workflows to generate code on demand, while manually intervening to handle complex edge cases and ensure the AI's logic remains sound and secure.

**Key Responsibilities**

· **Agentic Systems Design:** Build multi\-agent orchestration frameworks where autonomous agents collaborate to solve complex, multi\-step tasks.

· **Full\-Stack Pilot Development:** Use **Cursor or similar tools** to rapidly deliver Python backends and functional frontends, maintaining a 3x–5x velocity over traditional methods.

· **Agentic Orchestration \& Memory:** Implement stateful workflows, memory persistence, and tool\-calling protocols (e.g., **Model Context Protocol**) to enable agents to interact with external data and services.

· **Technical Supervision:** Conduct real\-time reviews of AI\-generated code to prevent architectural drift or ""sideways"" logic, ensuring every deployment is production\-ready.

· **Azure Deployment:** Leverage **Microsoft Foundry** and **Azure AI Search** to host, monitor, and ground agentic systems with enterprise data.

**Technical Requirements**

· **Core Languages:** Expert\-level **Python** (FastAPI, LangChain, or LangGraph).

· **AI\-Native Workflow:** Mastery of **Cursor or similar tools** for repo\-wide reasoning and automated refactoring.

· **Agentic Frameworks:** Proven experience building **agentic systems** with loops, self\-correction, and tool\-use capabilities.

· **Cloud Ecosystem:** Hands\-on experience with **Azure** and **Microsoft Foundry** for model management and agent deployment.

· **Bonus Skills:** Proficiency in **.NET / C\#** for integrating agentic features into existing enterprise microservices.

· **Governance \& Safety:** Ability to implement ""Human\-in\-the\-loop"" (HITL) triggers and guardrails to prevent unsafe agent actions.

Who You Are:

· The Workflow Architect: You think in ""thought trails"" and ""reflection loops"" rather than just single\-step functions.

· Agent\-First Builder: You prefer building autonomous ""swarms"" that handle repetitive tasks, saving your manual coding for the most critical logic.

· High Accountability: You take full ownership of the end\-to\-end product, ensuring that the speed of AI development never compromises system integrity.

· You have an attitude of Exceeding Expectations in everything you do

· You are a team collaborator working with business teams directly and technical teams to listen to their inputs but work alongside them in a fun and harmonious environment.

· You believe in yourself, you expand your capabilities constantly and believe in growing others around you.

Ensure excellence in production operations, including monitoring, incident response, model performance, and customer‑reported issues.
  
Drive strong engineering rigor across testing, release readiness, and post‑launch support.
  
Build scalable processes that support rapid iteration while maintaining enterprise‑grade reliability.
  
Required Qualifications
  
Over 15 years of experience in software engineering, with extensive expertise in machine learning or systems driven by artificial intelligence.
